Internship Tasks
In this project, I’ve built a linear regression model to predict house prices by analyzing factors like square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The data comes from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle. By focusing on these key aspects, my model helps provide accurate price predictions and offers insights into how each feature impacts the overall house value. I’ve used Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to develop, train, and assess the model, ensuring a thorough analysis of the housing data.
